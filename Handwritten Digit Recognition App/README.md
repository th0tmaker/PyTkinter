# Handwritten Digit Recognition App

<p align="center">

</p>

The Handwritten Digit Recognition App is a simple Python application that allows users to draw a digit on a canvas,
and an AI model will identify the drawn digit and provide a prediction along with a confidence level.
The app has been implemented using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and TensorFlow
for deep learning-based digit recognition.

## Demonstration Snippet

## Features

* **Drawing Canvas**: The app provides a canvas where users can draw a digit using their mouse or touchpad.


* **Digit Recognition**: Once the user submits the drawing, the AI model predicts the digit represented in the drawing
and displays the prediction.


* **Confidence Level**: The program also displays the confidence level of the model's prediction,
giving users an idea of how confident the model is in its prediction.


* **Clear Canvas**: Users can clear the canvas and start over if they wish to redraw the digit.

## Model

The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits, which can be found 
[here](https://github.com/th0tmaker/PyMachineLearning/blob/master/Handwritten%20Digit%20Classification(MNIST)/model.py)

## In Conclusion 
A simple and interactive way to showcase digit recognition using deep learning,
with a focus on providing an intuitive user interface.
